        "Your life is important. Please connect with the Crisis Lifeline at 988 or text HOME to 741741. There is help available.",
        "I am an AI and I care, but I can't provide the help you need right now. Please call 988.",

        "Hey! 👋 I'm here. How is your mental battery doing today?",
        "Hi there! This is a safe space. What's on your mind?",

        "What's up? I'm ready to chat if you need to vent.",
        "Hello! I'm here to support you. How are you feeling right now?",
        "Hi! It's good to see you. Dealing with anything heavy, or just checking in?",

    anxiety: [
        "I hear you. Anxiety is like a storm, but storms do pass. Let's just breathe for a second.",
        "That sounds really overwhelming. Can you name 3 things you see around you right now? It helps ground the mind.",
        "It makes sense that you feel this way. Anxiety tells us stories that aren't always true.",
        "Take a deep breath with me. 🌬️ In... and out. You are safe here.",
        "I'm sorry it's so loud in your head right now. I'm here to sit with you through it.",
        "You are stronger than this feeling. It's uncomfortable, but it can't hurt you.",
        "Let's take it one minute at a time. You don't have to solve everything right now.",
        "It’s okay to feel anxious. It’s your body trying to protect you, even if it’s a false alarm.",
        "Is there a small step we can take to lower the volume on that worry?",
        "Unclench your jaw, drop your shoulders. I'm right here with you.",
        "That racing heart is just energy. You are safe. You are okay.",
        "I imagine that feels really scary. But you've survived 100% of your bad days so far."

    stress: [
        "That sounds remarkably heavy. You're carrying a lot.",
        "It's completely normal to feel stressed with that much on your plate.",
        "It sounds like you're juggling a dozen things at once. No wonder you're tired.",
        "Remember: 'Rest' is also a productive activity. You can't pour from an empty cup.",
        "I hear how much pressure you're under. It's okay to put the heavy things down for a moment.",
        "You're doing the best you can with what you have. That is enough.",
        "That sounds incredibly frustrating. I'm listening.",
        "Let's break it down. What's the one thing that feels heaviest right now?",
        "Who is looking out for *you* in all of this? Make sure to take a breath.",
        "Stress is a signal that you care, but don't let it burn you out.",
        "I can see why you'd be stressed. That is a lot for one person to handle.",
        "Is there anything you can say 'no' to today, just to buy yourself some peace?"

        "It's okay not to be okay. Treat yourself gently today, please.",
        "I hear you, and your feelings are valid. You don't have to 'fix' this feeling right away.",
        "Sadness is heavy. You don't have to carry it all by yourself.",
        "I'm glad you shared that with me. It takes courage to be vulnerable.",
        "Be kind to yourself today. You're navigating some tough waters.",
        "It's okay to just exist today. You don't have to achieve anything to be worthy.",
        "This feeling is a wave. It will wash over, and you will still be standing.",
        "I'm here. I'm listening. You are not alone in this.",
        "Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is just make it through the day.",
        "Do you want to talk about what triggered this, or just sit in company for a bit?"

        "I'm here to connect. Tell me more about what's on your mind.",
        "You matter. Your thoughts matter. I'm glad you're talking to me.",
        "Is there a comforting activity you can do for yourself right now?",
        "Sending you warmth. ☀️ You are deserving of connection.",

    academic: [
        "School pressure is real. Remember, you are more than a grade.",
        "Exams are stressful, but they don't define your worth as a human.",
        "It sounds like you're working incredibly hard. don't forget to hydrate.",
        "Academic burnout is tough. Have you taken a 5-minute break lately?",
        "One assignment at a time. You can do this.",
        "It makes sense to be anxious about grades. It shows you care about your future.",
        "Don't sacrifice your mental health for a GPA. You are the priority.",
        "You've handled tough workloads before. I believe in your resilience.",
        "Is there a small win we can celebrate today? Did you read one page?",
        "Study breaks are part of studying. Your brain needs time to process."
    ],
    sleep: [
        "Racing thoughts at night are the worst. Try to focus on the feeling of your blanket.",
        "If you can't sleep, that's okay. Just resting your body is good too.",
        "Maybe try the 4-7-8 breathing technique? In for 4, hold for 7, out for 8.",
        "The world will wait for you to wake up. It's safe to let go now.",
        "It's hard when the mind won't shut off. I'm here if you need to dump the thoughts out.",
        "Visualize a candle flame. Just watch it flicker. 🕯️",
